Using RNA-seq data from cancer patients to determine optimal therapuetic with machine learning

# Cancer and Chemotherapuetics

Roughly 1.8 million adults are diagnosed with cancer in the United States each year. Less than 1%, or about 16,000 of those cases are ages 0-19. Most pediatric cancers are rare and as such are difficult to study. For example, there are roughly 100 cases of hepatoblastoma (pediatric liver cancer) in the United States this year. With such (relatively) small sample numbers, and less research being done than for adult cancer its important to find ways to pull information from adult cancer and be able to generalize it to pediatric cancer. 

Chemotherapy is generally a non-targeted, non-specific treatment. What if there is something broadly in the gene expression of a patient that may point to what chemotherapuetic may be best for them? Developing a methodology to could minimize bad outcomes, side effects, and could potentially be generalized to smaller cancer populations like hepatoblastoma patients.
